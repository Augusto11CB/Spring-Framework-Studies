## What Is Aspect Oriented Programming?
AOP comes to solve a problem with code that is called **code of crosscutting functionallity**, such as logging, validation, user rights checks, caching, exception handling, etc. By moving it from the business code logic in order to avoid the latter being mixed with the others.

The main ideia is to remove and create specialized classes for those crosscutting functionallity, which also can be called **aspects (modularization of a concern)**

1. Do something before the method
2. Call the method
3. Do something after the method
