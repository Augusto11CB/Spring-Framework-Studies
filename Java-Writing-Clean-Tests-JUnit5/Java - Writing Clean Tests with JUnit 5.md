## Unit Test

**Benefitis** 
- quick feedback
- automated regression checking
- design aid - If is hard to write some test for a code, it maybe an indicative of bad design
- Improves confidence
- acts as a documentation 

## JUnit 5

### Test Lifecycle

#### **@Test Annotation**
The `@Test` marks methods that are to be run as tests.

####  @Before and @After Annotations
-   `@BeforeAll`: Annotated a method with this annotation makes it run once before any test method.
Also, the annotated method must be  `static`. 
-   `@BeforeEach`: Annotated a method with this annotation makes it **be invoked before each test method.**
-   `@AfterEach`:   Annotated a method with this annotation makes it **be invoked after each test method.**
-   The method that is annotated with the  `@AfterAll`  annotation must be  `static`, and itâ€™s run once after all test methods have been run.

#### @DisplayName - 

### Assert methods

- `assert(Not)Equals`
- `assert(Not)Same` 
- `assertFalse/assertTrue`
- `assertIterableEquals`: compares two collections 
- `assertThrows`: explicitly verifies that when a certain code is called within a context an expection is thrown
```java
//todo
```
- `assertAll`: 
```java
//todo
```

### Running Groups of Tests -

#### Executing Tests by Tag Expressions
```java
@Tag("dateTime")
@DisplayName("Date time converter should")
class DateTimeConverterShould {
	....
}
```
